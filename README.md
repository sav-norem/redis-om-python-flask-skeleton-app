This is the code base for using Redis OM in a flask app with Food Truck data. This app will highlight and help you explore using RedisJSON and RediSearch while also using some of the features of Redis OM for Python.

This app is forked from https://github.com/redis-developer/redis-om-python-flask-skeleton-app - that page has significant documentation about how to get started with the app.

This code is from the livestream you can find recorded here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZP2j7bmWfmU&list=PL83Wfqi-zYZHSnOXH3kCkgyfk3Rqo_wzH
